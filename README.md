# Sentiment-Analysis-using-BERT

This project is aimed at analyzing the consumer sentiment towards arts and cultural experiences in British museums by using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. The sentiment analysis is performed on a dataset of 2+ years of tweets related to museum experiences.

## Dataset 

Wang, Bo; Tsakalidis, Adam; Liakata, Maria; Zubiaga, Arkaitz; Procter, Rob; Jensen, Eric (2016): [SMILE Twitter Emotion dataset](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3187909.v2)

## Methodology

The BERT model is used to perform sentiment analysis on the dataset. The model is trained on the dataset and then used to classify the sentiment of each tweet in the dataset as anger, disgust, happiness, surprise or sadness. The results of the sentiment analysis are then used to determine the overall consumer sentiment towards arts and cultural experiences in British museums.
